**Objective**

The objective is to show faculty female ratio in art departments of US universities.
Targeted audience are female academics or artists who are working for or considering looking for a job in US universities.

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

* The title and annotation are misleading. It guides the audience to believe that gender is the only reason that it is hard for female academics or artists to find a job in US universities. 
* Colour selection. The gradient colour is not necessary. Normally gradient colour represents quantitative data change. In this case, it confuses the audience. The total percentage is represented by dark gray circle which is not obvious in the black background.
* Using area to represent main quantitative variable has low accuracy. It is not easy to visually compare areas across universities. In addition, the inner circle area seems like it occupies a much larger proportion.
